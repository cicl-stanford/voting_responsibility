    <p>Your task in this experiment is to decide to what extent different politicians who voted in a committee on whether a new policy should be passed are responsible for the outcome of the vote.</p>
    <p>You will see the outcomes of a number of different votes on different policies. The votes differ in how many people were in the committee. Whether or not a policy is passed depends on how many of the politicians voted for it. Some policies require more votes than others in order to be passed. Below is an example of a vote:</p>

      <p style="font-size:18px; text-align: center; margin-top:1em;"><b>Outcome</b>: The policy was <b> passed</b>.</p><p style="font-size:17px; text-align: center;"> 3 out of 4 committee members voted in favor of the policy and at least 2 votes were required for the policy to pass.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>In this example, the vote was about policy #123187 which was supported by the Republican party. 4 politicians were in the committee. In order for the policy to be passed, at least 2 committee members were required to vote for it.</p>

      <p><b>John</b>, a Republican, voted for the policy. So did <b>Bill</b>, also a Republican. <b>Steve</b>, a Democrat, didn't vote for the policy. <b>Robert</b>, another Democrat, voted in favor of the policy.</p>

      <p>Since 3 out of 4 committee members voted for the policy and 2 votes were required for the policy to pass, the policy was accepted.</p> 

      <p>Each of the committee members knows the following information before they make a decision whether to vote for the policy:</p>

      <ol type="a">
        <li>the number of people in the committee</li>
        <li>the minimum number of votes required for the policy to pass</li>
        <li>each politician's political affiliation</li>
        <li>whether the policy is supported by the Democratic or Republican party</li>
      </ol>

      <p>In the experiment, you will judge to what extent different committee members are responsible for whether or not a given policy was passed.</p>
